<strong>1. First Time Use</strong>
<p>It is advised that users practice a trial run before using the app at a game. Not only does this familiarize the user with the app, but it also sorts out any memory full or other data storage errors before it becomes critical that these be avoided.</p>
<p>a. Tap “Team A” to bring up keyboard to enter the name of your team. If you are only keeping data on one team, always make it team A. Do not enter any team names or numbers for Team B if you do not wish to collect any data for the opposition. If you want to keep data on the opposition, but do not know their names, then just enter their numbers, and leave the name field blank. Team A is always the team on the left in this program. Even if you change the team name from Team A to your own name, when abbreviated data is displayed, A will be used.</p>
<p>b. Tap &amp; hold the player line to bring up keyboard to enter player number &amp; player name. Do the same for Team B if you wish to record data for the opposition. Note the order you enter the players will remain for the duration of the game. The app does not auto sort players numerically or alphabetically.</p>
<p>c. Adjust the game clock by using the up and down arrows. Tap &amp; hold the arrow for faster cycling of numbers. Enter the duration of each quarter or half.<br />
  d. Tap &amp; hold the green Foul square to select the permitted number of team fouls.</p>
<p>e. Tap &amp; hold the green square on a player line to select the number of personal fouls permitted. This will be applied automatically to all players, so you only need to do this once for one player.</p>
<p>f. Select which players are going to start the match.  A player is on when their line is blue, and off when grey. Tap a player name to add or remove a player from the court. Substitutions during the match are performed in this way, but only when the game clock is stopped. You must have at least 2 players from Team A to start a match. You can choose to ignore the error messages if you don’t want to track Team B. A black dot appears next to a player’s name to indicate they took the court, one dot for each half.</p>
<p>g. Tap the game clock when the referee starts the match. It will change colour to green and start running down.</p>
<p>h. Follow the flashing prompts to enter data. The app will use flashing borders and names to indicate from which group of buttons the next press should come from.</p>
<p><strong>2. Switching between ‘Score &amp; Stat’ mode &amp; ‘Score Only’ mode.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tap the double ended arrow at the bottom of the screen to switch between the two modes. This can be done at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Starting a new match.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Select “Start a New Match” from the welcome/home screen.</li>
  <li>If the app has previously stored team names and player names, choose which you want to keep and which to delete.</li>
  <li>Edit, add or delete players as necessary.</li>
  <li>Check the game clock is set for the prescribed period duration, and check the foul count for team &amp; players is correct. Select how you want the game clock to operate. The default is to stop on fouls. Turning on A will result in the game clock stopping on fouls &amp; shots made. Turning on C will mean the clock is continuous, stopping only for time outs.</li>
  <li>Select the players to start the match.</li>
  <li>Tap the game clock to start the match. <br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. Sequence of button pressing.</strong></p>
<p>This app has been designed to guide the user with flashing borders. The groups of buttons to be pressed next will flash. The user must select from these before moving onto the next entry. Some entries require the DONE button to be pressed, and some do not. Stat entries do not require it to be pressed. Either DONE button can be used for either team.</p>
<p>You can skip the entry of shot location by pressing the DONE button to move on.</p>
<p>The game clock stops automatically when certain actions are entered. The user will have time to enter the action press done, and then will need to tap the red game clock when the ball is brought back into play. While the game clock is stopped red, adjustments to the time can be made using the up &amp; down arrows. Use this function to match the actual game clock on the score board.</p>
<p>If the game stops for a reason other than a foul, time out or basket, then the user will have to stop the game clock manually. This is done by tapping the green game clock.</p>
<p>When a shot is made at basket, the half court graphic will flash after the player making the shot has been tapped. Tap the location from where the shot was taken and then press the DONE button. If you do not wish to record location of the shot, you can skip this step by pressing the DONE button instead of the half court graphic.</p>
<p>Time Outs are recorded by tapping the green square on the Time Out line under the team that called the time out.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>5. Error corrections &amp; data checking.</strong></p>
<p>The user can correct a mistake of the last entry by pressing the REDO LAST button. The actions involved in the last entry will flash. Just tap the correct entry and press done.</p>
<p>If the user wants to correct an action made a few plays prior, then tapping Edit/Check will bring up a sequential list of actions, which the user can scroll through to select the one they wish to edit. Tapping this will flash the actions involved, &amp; the user taps the button that should have been tapped at the time.</p>
<p><strong>6. Period End &amp; Game End.</strong></p>
<p>When the clock reaches zero, at the end of the 1st qtr, Period End flashes. Tap this and then answer the questions regarding team fouls &amp; time outs. Make any substitutions, and tap the game clock when play starts again.</p>
<p>At the end of the 2nd qtr both Period End &amp; Game End flash. If it is only half time press the Period End button, but if it was a game of two halves, then tap the Game End button.</p>
<p><strong>7. Score Card</strong></p>
<p>When Game End is tapped, the score card will appear on the screen. The user then has a few fields to enter if they wish.</p>
<p>Match Name – the program will assign a default name based on the time &amp; date of the match if this field is left blank. </p>
<p>Use the NEXT button to move between fields, and when finished use the ENTER key or Hide Keyboard key to press DONE when completed.</p>
<p>When DONE is pressed, all the match data will be stored on the user’s iPad. At the welcome screen the user can view these stored matches by tapping View Stored Matches. </p>
<p><strong>8. Statistical Reports</strong></p>
<p>The default screen when statistics is selected is a team A’s overview. Tapping on a player line will bring up that player’s individual stats including where their shots were taken from. Tapping on the ALL line will bring up team’s stats &amp; shots. Circled numbers in the shots taken graphic represent the number of the player and indicate that their shot was successful. Numbers not circled are missed shots.</p>
<p>Swiping left or right will bring up team B’s stats if they were entered.</p>
<p><strong>9. Raw Match Data</strong></p>
<p>Selecting this option will bring up a full sequential history of every action entered during the match.</p>
